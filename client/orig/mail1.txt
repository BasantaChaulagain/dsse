Per updated advice today from the bankruptcy attorneys, we are on hold for issuing refunds to employees for pre-petition deductions  that were not remitted to vendors.  This occurred for November's United Way, savings bonds and direct stock purchase deductions.

What happened -
Payroll occurred on Friday, November 30th (pre petition).
The remittance wires to the vendors were prepared on Monday, December 3rd (post petition) and were held from payment.

I know this seems rotten, but we're absolutely on hold until they advise us whether we can issue refunds to employees.
We'll keep you posted.
